# mine_sweeper

## Introduction
This project is all about getting confident with C++ and with its strict and dangerous memory-handling methods.
It's also a nice way to get used to declaration-definition projects development (.hpp and .cpp files) and to compiling tools
such as Makefile.

## The game
Inspired by a C++ programming language's lecture, where the steps to achieve a basic 'mine sweeper' game mechanics were discussed
(although whithout talking about how the user would have had to interact with the game itself), I decided to challenge myself
to create a very simple and intuitive graphic interface and a under-the-hood mechanics of the famous game.


## working updates
I've already created a very simple but ready to use terminal-based interface
